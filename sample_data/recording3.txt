do you ever think of yourself as
actually being dead lying in a box with
a lid on it no nor do
I
really it's silly to get depressed by it
I
mean one thinks of it like being alive
in a box one keeps forgetting to take
into account the fact that one is
dead well which should make a difference
shouldn't
it I mean you'd never know you were in a
box would you it would be just like
being asleep in a box not that I'd like
to sleep in the Box mind not without any
air you'd wake up dead for a start
