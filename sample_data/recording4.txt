i'm afraid john i can't congratulate you
all emotions and in particular love
stand opposed to the pure cult reason i
hold above all things a wedding is in my
considered opinion nothing short of a
celebration of all that is false and
specious and irrational and sentimental
in this ailing and morally compromised
world today we honor the death watch
beetle that is the doom of our society
and in time one feels certain our entire
species
but anyway let's talk about john please
if i burden myself with a little help
make during my adventures this is not
out of sentiment or caprice it is that
he has many fine qualities of his own
that he has overlooked in his obsession
with me indeed any reputation i have for
mental acuity and sharpness comes in
truth from the extraordinary contrast
john so selflessly provides it is a fact
i believe the brides tend to favor
exceptionally plain bridesmaids for
their big day there is a certain analogy
there i feel and contrast is after all
god's own plan to enhance the beauty of
his creation or it would be if god were
not a ludicrous fantasy designed to
provide a career opportunity for the
family idiot
the point i'm trying to make is that i
am
the most
unpleasant
rude
ignorant and all-round obnoxious
that anyone could possibly have the
misfortune to meet
i am dismissive of the virtuous
unaware of the beautiful
and uncomprehending in the face of the
happy if i didn't understand i was being
asked to be best man it is because i
never expected to be anybody's best
friend
certainly not the best friend
or the bravest and kindest and wisest
human being i have ever had the good
fortune of knowing
john i am a ridiculous man
redeemed only by the warmth and
constancy of your friendship
but as i'm apparently your best friend i
cannot congratulate you on your choice
of companion
actually now i can
mary when i say you deserve this man
it is the highest compliment of which i
am capable
john you have endured war
and injury
and tragic loss
so sorry again about that last one so
know this today you sit between
the woman you have made your wife and
the man you have saved
in short the two people who love you
most in all this world
and i know i speak for mary as well when
i say we will never let you down and we
have a lifetime ahead to prove that
ah yes now onto some funny stories about
john
what's wrong what happened why are you
all doing that jon
did i do it wrong
no you didn't come in
i haven't finished yet yeah i know come
on
so on to some funny stories
so on to some funny stories about john
